Currently, cascaded text-to-speech (TTS) systems (Tacotron2 (2017), FastSpeech (2019), Transformer TTS (2018)) usually leverage a pipeline with an acoustic model and a vocoder using mel spectrograms as the intermediate representations. While advanced TTS systems can synthesize high-quality speech from single or multiple speakers (DelightfulTTS2 (2022), VITS (2021)), it still requires high-quality clean data from the recording studio. Large-scale data crawled from the Internet cannot meet the requirement, and always lead to performance degradation. Because the training data is relatively small, current TTS systems still suffer from poor generalization. Speaker similarity and speech naturalness decline dramatically for unseen speakers in the zero-shot scenario.</p> <p>To tackle the zero-shot TTS problem, existing work leverages speaker adaptation [Chen et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020] and speaker encoding [Arik et al., 2018, YourTTS (2021)] methods, requiring additional fine-tuning, complex pre-designed features, or heavy structure engineering.</p> <p>Instead of designing a complex and specific network for this problem, the ultimate solution is to train a model with large and diverse data as much as possible, motivated by success in the field of text synthesis [Brown et al., 2020, Chowdhery et al., 2022]. Recent years have witnessed notable performance improvement for data increase in the text language model, from 16GB of uncompressed text [Devlin et al., 2019], to 160GB [Liu et al., 2019], to 570GB [Brown et al., 2020], and finally, around 1TB [Chowdhery et al., 2022]. Transferring this success to the field of speech synthesis, we introduce VALL-E, the first language model-based TTS framework leveraging large, diverse, and multi-speaker speech data.</p> <p></p> <p>As shown in Fig.01, to synthesize personalized speech (e.g., zero-shot TTS), VALL-E generates the corresponding acoustic tokens conditioned on the acoustic tokens of the 3-second enrolled recording and the phoneme prompt, which constrain the speaker and content information respectively. Finally, the generated acoustic tokens are used to synthesize the final waveform with the corresponding neural codec decoder [D\u00e9fossez et al., 2022]. The discrete acoustic tokens derived from an audio codec model enable us to treat TTS as conditional codec language modeling and advanced prompting-based large-model techniques (as in GPTs [Brown et al., 2020])can be leveraged for the TTS tasks. The acoustic tokens also allow us to generate diverse synthesized results in TTS by using different sampling strategies during inference.</p> <p>We train VALL-E with LibriLight [Kahn et al., 2020], a corpus consisting of 60K hours of English speech with over 7000 unique speakers. The original data is audio-only, so we employ a speech recognition model to generate the transcriptions. Compared to previous TTS training datasets, such as LibriTTS [Zen et al., 2019], our data contain more noisy speech and inaccurate transcriptions but provide diverse speakers and prosodies. We believe the proposed approach is robust to the noise and generalize well by leveraging large data. It is worth noting that existing TTS systems are always trained with dozens of hours of single-speaker data or hundreds of hours of multi-speaker data, which is over hundreds of times smaller than VALL-E. Tab.01 summarizes the innovation of VALL-E, a language model approach for TTS, using audio codec codes as intermediate representations, leveraging large and diverse data, leading to strong in-context learning capabilities.</p> Table 1 Current Systems VALL-E Intermediate Representation Mel Spectrogram Audio Codec Code Objective Function Continuous Signal Regression Language Model Training Data \u2264600 Hours 60K Hours In-Context Language \u00d7 \u221a <p>We evaluate VALL-E on LibriSpeech [Panayotov et al., 2015] and VCTK [Veaux et al., 2016]datasets, where all test speakers are unseen in the training corpus. VALL-E significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS system (YourTTS (2021)) in terms of speech naturalness and speaker similarity, with +0.12 comparative mean option score (CMOS) and +0.93 similarity mean option score (SMOS) improvement on LibriSpeech. VALL-E also beats the baseline on VCTK with+0.11 SMOS and +0.23 CMOS improvements. It even achieves a +0.04 CMOS score against ground truth, showing the synthesized speech of unseen speakers is as natural as human recordings on VCTK. Moreover, the qualitative analysis shows that VALL-E is able to synthesize diverse outputs with the same text and target speaker, which could benefit pseudo-data creation for the speech recognition task. We also find that VALL-E could keep the acoustic environment (e.g., reverberation) and emotion (e.g. anger) of the acoustic prompt.</p> <p>In summary, we make the following contributions. - We propose VALL-E, the first TTS framework with strong in-context learning capabilities as GPT-3, which treats TTS as a language model task with audio codec codes as an intermediate representation to replace the traditional mel spectrogram. It has in-context learning capability and enables prompt-based approaches for zero-shot TTS, which does not require additional structure engineering, pre-designed acoustic features, and fine-tuning as in previous work. - We build a generalized TTS system in the speaker dimension by leveraging a huge amount of semi-supervised data, suggesting that simple scaling up semi-supervised data has been underestimated for TTS. - VALL-E is able to provide diverse outputs with the same input text and keep the acoustic environment and speaker\u2019s emotion of the acoustic prompt. - We verify that VALL-E synthesizes natural speech with high speaker similarity by prompt-ing in the zero-shot scenario. Evaluation results show that VALL-E significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS system on LibriSpeech and VCTK.</p> <p>We encourage the reader to listen to our samples on the demo page https://aka.ms/valle.</p>","tags":["\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210_TTS","\u96f6\u6837\u672c_Zero-Shot","\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668_Codec","\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b_LLM"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/2023.01_VALL-E/2023.01_VALL-E/#2related-work","title":"2.Related Work","text":"","tags":["\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210_TTS","\u96f6\u6837\u672c_Zero-Shot","\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668_Codec","\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b_LLM"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/2023.01_VALL-E/2023.01_VALL-E/#21zero-shot-tts","title":"2.1.Zero-Shot TTS","text":"<p>Current TTS methods can be categorized into cascaded and end-to-end methods. Cascaded TTS systems (Tacotron2 (2017), FastSpeech (2019), Transformer TTS (2018)) usually leverage a pipeline with an acoustic model and a vocoder using mel spectrograms as the intermediate representations. To tackle the drawbacks of the vocoder, end-to-end TTS models (VITS (2021), DelightfulTTS2 (2022)) are proposed to jointly optimize the acoustic model and vocoder. In real scenarios, it is highly desirable to customize a TTS system to an arbitrary voice with rare enrolled recordings. Therefore, there is growing interest in the zero-shot multi-speaker TTS techniques, and most of work is done in the context of cascaded TTS systems. As the pioneers, Arik et al.2018 proposes speaker adaptation and speaker encoding approaches. In the line of speaker adaptation, the following work [Chen et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2021] tries to improve the adaptation efficiency with less target speaker data and speaker-specific parameters. Huang et al.[2022] applies meta-learning on speaker adaptation, which only requires 5-shot to build a well-performed system. In parallel, speaker encoding-based methods achieved great progress in recent years. A speaker encoding based system contains a speaker encoder and a TTS component, where the speaker encoder could be pre-trained on the speaker verification task [Jia et al., 2018]. In Jia et al.[2018] and Arik et al.[2018], the experiments show that the model is able to generate high-quality outputs with 3 seconds enrolled recordings for in-domain speakers. To improve the quality of unseen speakers, advanced speaker embedding models [Cai et al., 2018] can be employed, but it is still undesirable according to Tan et al.[2021]. Another way is to design advanced but complex speaker encoder [Wu et al., 2022].Diffusion model based TTS [Popov et al., 2021, Kim et al., 2022] is also extended to zero-shot TTS [Kang et al., 2022] and achieved good results. Compared to previous work [FastSpeech (2019), Du et al.,2022], our work follows the line of cascaded TTS but first uses audio codec code as intermediate representations.

In the context of speech-to-speech generation, a hot topic is how to synthesize speech in a textless setting. GSLM [Lakhotia et al.,2021] proposes to synthesize speech based on HuBERT (2021) codes, and Polyak et al.[2021] improves the performance by combining HuBERT codes with codes of VQVAE and a speaker encoder. AudioLM (2022) follows a similar way but use audio codecs [Zeghidour et al.,2022] to synthesize speech, together with semantic codes. It should be noted that AudioLM is able to synthesize speech based on audio codecs without training an additional vocoder such as HifiGAN (2020). AudioLM is a speech-to-speech model, whereas VALL-E is a TTS model, so we can explicitly control the content in speech synthesis. Another direction is to apply pre-training to the neural TTS. Chung et al.[2018] pre-trains speech decoder in TTS through autoregressive mel-spectrogram prediction. In Ao et al.[2022], the authors propose a unified-modal encoder-decoder framework SpeechT5, which can leverage unlabeled speech and text data to pre-train all components of TTS model. Tjandra et al.[2019] quantizes unlabeled speech into discrete tokens by a VQVAE model [van den Oord et al., 2017], and train a model with the token-to-speech sequence. They demonstrate that the pre-trained model only requires a small amount of real data for fine-tuning. Bai et al.[2022] proposes mask and reconstruction on mel spectrogram and showing better performance on speech editing and synthesis. Previous TTS pre-training work leverages less than 1K hours of data, whereas VALL-E is pre-trained with 60K hours of data. Furthermore, VALL-E is the first to use audio codec codes as intermediate representations, and emerge in-context learning capability in zero-shot TTS.</p>","tags":["\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210_TTS","\u96f6\u6837\u672c_Zero-Shot","\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668_Codec","\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b_LLM"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/2023.01_VALL-E/2023.01_VALL-E/#3background-speech-quantization","title":"3.Background: Speech Quantization","text":"<p>Since audio is typically stored as a sequence of 16-bit integer values, a generative model is required to output $2^{16}=65,536$ probabilities per timestep to synthesize the raw audio. In addition, the audio sample rate exceeding ten thousand leads to an extraordinarily long sequence length, making it more intractable for raw audio synthesis. To this end, speech quantization is required to compress integer values and sequence length.  $\\mu$-law transformation can quantize each timestep to 256 values and reconstruct high-quality raw audio. It is widely used in speech generative models, such as WaveNet [van den Oord et al., 2016], but the inference speed is still slow since the sequence length is not reduced. Recently, vector quantization is widely applied in self-supervised speech models for feature extraction, such as vq-wav2vec [Baevski et al., 2020a] and HuBERT (2021). The following work [Lakhotia et al., 2021, Du et al., 2022] shows the codes from self-supervised models can also reconstruct content, and the inference speed is faster than WaveNet. However, the speaker identity has been discarded and the reconstruction quality is low AudioLM (2022). AudioLM (2022) trains speech-to-speech language models on both k-means tokens from a self-supervised model and acoustic tokens from a neural codec model, leading to high-quality speech-to-speech generation.</p> <p>In this paper, we follow AudioLM (2022) to leverage neural codec models to represent speech in discrete tokens. To compress audio for network transmission, codec models are able to encode waveform into discrete acoustic codes and reconstruct high-quality waveform even if the speaker is unseen in training. Compared to traditional audio codec approaches, the neural-based codec is significantly better at low bitrates, and we believe the quantized tokens contain sufficient information about the speaker and recording conditions. Compared to other quantization methods,the audio codec shows the following advantages:  1. It contains abundant speaker information and acoustic information, which could maintain speaker identity in reconstruction compared to HuBERT (2021) codes. 2. There is an off-the-shelf codec decoder to convert discrete tokens into a waveform, without the additional efforts on vocoder training like VQ-based methods that operated on spectrum [Du et al., 2022]. 3. It could reduce the length of time steps for efficiency to address the problem in $\\mu$-law transformation [van den Oord et al., 2016].</p> <p>We adopt a pre-trained neural audio codec model, EnCodec [D\u00e9fossez et al., 2022], as our tokenizer. EnCodec is a convolutional encoder-decoder model, whose input and output are both 24 kHz audio across variable bitrates. The encoder produces embeddings at 75 Hz for input waveforms at 24 kHz,which is a 320-fold reduction in the sampling rate. Each embedding is modeled by a residual vector quantization (RVQ), in which we choose eight hierarchy quantizers with 1024 entries each as shown in Fig.02.</p> <p></p> <p>This configuration corresponds to EnCodec at 6K bitrates for 24 kHz audio reconstruction. In this setting, given a 10-second waveform, the discrete representation is a matrix with750 \u00d7 8entries, where 750 =24,000\u00d710/320 is the downsampled time step and 8 is the number of quantizers. It is fine to choose other bitrate settings. A larger bitrate corresponds to more quantizers and better reconstruction quality. For example, if we choose EnCodecc at 12K bitrates, there are 16 quantizers are needed and the 10-second waveform corresponds to a matrix with 750\u00d716 entries. With the discrete codes from all quantizers, the convolutional decoder of EnCodec generates real-valued embeddings and reconstructs the waveform at 24 kHz.</p>","tags":["\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210_TTS","\u96f6\u6837\u672c_Zero-Shot","\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668_Codec","\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b_LLM"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/2023.01_VALL-E/2023.01_VALL-E/#4vall-e","title":"4.VALL-E","text":"","tags":["\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210_TTS","\u96f6\u6837\u672c_Zero-Shot","\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668_Codec","\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b_LLM"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/2023.01_VALL-E/2023.01_VALL-E/#41problem-formulation-regarding-tts-as-conditional-codec-language-modeling","title":"4.1.Problem Formulation: Regarding TTS as Conditional Codec Language Modeling","text":"<p>Given a dataset $\\mathcal{D}={\\mathbf{x}i, \\mathbf{y}_i}$, where $\\mathbf{y}$ is an audio sample and $\\mathbf{x} = {x_0,x_1, \\cdots x_L}$ is its corresponding phoneme transcription, we use a pre-trained neural codec model to encode each audio sample into discrete acoustic codes, denoted as $\\text{Encodec}(\\mathbf{y}) = C^{T\\times 8}$, where $C$ represents the two-dimensional acoustic code matrix, and $T$ is the downsampled utterance length.

We pre-train VALL-E with 60K hours of speech data, and show the in-context learning capability in zero-shot scenarios.  We achieve new state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS results on LibriSpeech and VCTK.  Furthermore, VALL-E could keep the acoustic environment and speaker\u2019s emotion in synthesis, and provide diverse outputs in different sampling-based decoding processes.</p> <p>Despite making significant progress, VALL-E still suffers from several issues.</p> <p>Synthesis robustness We observe that some words may be unclear, missed, or duplicated in speech synthesis.  It is mainly because the phoneme-to-acoustic language part is an autoregressive model, in which disordered attention alignments exist and no constraints to solving the issue.  The phenomenon is also observed in vanilla Transformer-based TTS, which was addressed by applying non-autoregressive models or modifying the attention mechanism in modeling.  In the future, we would like to leverage these techniques to solve the issue.</p> <p>Data coverage Even if we use 60K hours of data for training, it still cannot cover everyone\u2019s voice,especially accent speakers.  The worse result on VCTK than LibriSpeech also implies insufficient coverage of accent speakers. Moreover, the diversity of speaking styles is not enough, as LibriLight is an audiobook dataset, in which most utterances are in reading style.  In the future, we will further scale up the training data to improve the model performance across prosody, speaking style, and speaker similarity perspectives.  We believe the zero-shot TTS task could be almost solved through our approach with model and data scale-up.</p> <p>Model Structure Now, we use two models to predict codes of different quantizers.

Another interesting direction is using full NAR models to speed up model inference in the framework.</p> <p>Broader impacts Since VALL-E could synthesize speech that maintains speaker identity, it may carry potential risks in misuse of the model, such as spoofing voice identification or impersonating a specific speaker.  To mitigate such risks, it is possible to build a detection model to discriminate whether an audio clip was synthesized by VALL-E.

While developing TTS architectures that train and test on the same set of speakers has seen significant improvements, out-of-domain speaker performance still faces enormous limitations. Domain adaptation on a new set of speakers can be achieved by fine-tuning the whole model for each new domain, thus making it parameter-inefficient. This problem can be solved by Adapters that provide a parameter-efficient alternative to domain adaptation. Although famous in NLP, speech synthesis has not seen much improvement from Adapters. In this work, we present HyperTTS, which comprises a small learnable network, \"hypernetwork\", that generates parameters of the Adapter blocks, allowing us to condition Adapters on speaker representations and making them dynamic. Extensive evaluations of two domain adaptation settings demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving state-of-the-art performance in the parameter-efficient regime.

To make TTS scalable and economical, parameter-efficient adaptation of such systems to new speakers is an important, but highly challenging problem (Li et al., 2023b). Zero-shot and few-shot speaker adaptation techniques (Shen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Casanova et al., 2021; Cooper et al., 2020; Casanova et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2023) have gained prominence in the domain of TTS, aiming at accommodating new speakers and styles with limited speaker-specific data. While these methods excel in scenarios with constrained data, it\u2019s important to note that when sufficient data is available, fine-tuning the model offers distinct advantages. Fine-tuning allows for highly personalized and tailored speech synthesis, precise control over the alignment of synthesized speech with the speaker\u2019s characteristics, and the production of higher-quality, more natural-sounding speech. In this paper, we assume sufficient availability of data from the adaptation domain.When adapting a multi-speaker TTS model (backbone model) to a target domain, the traditional approach involves complete fine-tuning of the entire back bone (Figure 1-Fine-tuning).However, this approach is resource-intensive, requiring separate copies of model parameters for each new target domain. To make the adaptation scalable, recent research has introduced parameter-efficient do main adaptation methods using Adapters, as seen in NLP (Houlsby et al., 2019) and speech (Li et al., 2023b). Adapters incorporate small blocks of learn able dense layers into each block of the backbone model, with the aim of learning additional parameters while keeping the main model parameters fixed (Figure 1-AdapterTTS). Despite the advantages demonstrated by adapters in various NLP tasks, their direct application in adapting a TTS backbone to a target domain has shown limited improvements (Li et al., 2023b) Since learning a generic TTS system that works well across different speaker styles is a more difficult problem than learning one network per speaker (Ren et al., 2019a, 2021), we hypothesize the same is the case with adapters. Forcing a static set of adapter parameters to perform well across multiple speakers of the adaptation domain can be challenging and potentially infeasible due to under parameterization (Mehrish et al., 2023a; Biadsy et al., 2022). In this paper, we present HyperTTS, a pioneer ing approach for the parameter-efficient adaptation of TTS models to new speakers.This method conditions adapters on speaker embeddings, expanding the learnable parameter space through a \"hypernetwork\". The main highlights of HyperTTS are:. 1. Dynamic Adapters: Instead of keeping the adapters static, for each speaker in the adaptation domain, HyperTTS learns speaker adaptive adapters.Adapter conditioning on speaker representations is observed to unlock adapter capabilities and make them performant which was a challenge with static adapters (Li et al., 2023b). 2. Parameter Sampling: A large set of speak ers makes it infeasible to keep the space of adapter parameters discrete. To facilitate this, we employ parameter sampling from a continuous distribution defined by a learnable hyper network. 3. ParameterEfficiency: Compared to parameter-expensive fine-tuning, it achieves competitive results with less than1% of the backbone parameters, making it highly practical and resource-friendly for scalable applications.</p> <p>We perform a comprehensive set of experiments to showcase HyperTTS\u2019s effectiveness (see Figure 1) compared to traditional methods like static bottleneck adapters (AdapterTTS) and full model fine-tuning (TTS-FT). Our experiments cover datasets from diverse environmental conditions, such as LibriTTS and VCTK, representing various accents from different regions. Results highlight HyperTTS\u2019s parameter-efficient performance advantages over the baselines across both objective and subjective metrics.Notably, HyperTTS can even surpass fine-tuning in performance with only a 20% increase in parameters (Table 6-HyperTTS<sub>e/v/d</sub>). A key strength of HyperTTS lies in its remarkable parameter efficiency: it achieves results within 1 point of fine-tuning while using less than 1% of the parameter count in the backbone. This practical and resource-friendly approach enables real-world applications.</p>","tags":["\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210_TTS","\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc_HyperNetwork","\u5f00\u6e90_OpenSource"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/2024.04_HyperTTS/2024.04_HyperTTS/#2related-work","title":"2.Related Work","text":"","tags":["\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210_TTS","\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc_HyperNetwork","\u5f00\u6e90_OpenSource"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/2024.04_HyperTTS/2024.04_HyperTTS/#text-to-speech-models","title":"Text-to-Speech Models","text":"<p>The rise of deep learning has transformed TTS technology, with neural network-based architectures like Tacotron (2017); Tacotron2 (2017), FastSpeech2 (2020), and Transformer-TTS (2018) leading the way.

This research introduces an innovative approach, ==LLaMA-VITS==, which enhances TTS synthesis by enriching the semantic content of text using LLM. ==LLaMA-VITS== integrates semantic embeddings from LLaMA2 (2023) with the VITS model, a leading end-to-end TTS framework. By leveraging LLaMA2 (2023) for the primary speech synthesis process, our experiments demonstrate that ==LLaMA-VITS== matches the naturalness of the original VITS (ORI-VITS) and those incorporate BERT (BERT-VITS), on the LJSpeech dataset, a substantial collection of neutral, clear speech.

This technology finds application in the production of audiobooks (Chen et al., 2022) and virtual assistants (Wu et al., 2023). However, traditional TTS models, which primarily focus on the acoustic features, often fall short in comprehending the semantic and emotional information embedded within the text. With the significant advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, particularly through Language Models (LMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT (Radford et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020), which have demonstrated formidable capabilities in understanding and generating natural language, researchers have proposed various BERT-based TTS models (Mukherjee et al., 2022; Abbas et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2022) to improve the expressiveness of synthesized speech. Nonetheless, the effectiveness and flexibility of BERT-based TTS models in diverse applications are limited due to the smaller parameter size of BERT models and the necessity for designing specific fine-tuning tasks to enhance their capabilities. On the other hand, Large-scale Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA2 (2023), not only require decreasing computational re sources and achieve higher levels of text generation but also possess excellent zero-shot learning capabilities. Moreover, they can achieve improvements comparable to fine-tuning by adjusting only a minimal number of parameters through prompt tuning (Liu et al., 2022; Tu et al., 2022). However, the potential of these LLMs for TTS tasks has not been fully explored. In light of this context, we introduce ==LLaMA-VITS==, a model that leverages semantic representations extracted from LLaMA2 (2023) on top of a state-of-the-art TTS model, VITS (2021), enabling the generated speech to retain acoustic information while understanding and expressing semantics and emotions. Through comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations, ==LLaMA-VITS== has been verified to surpass TTS baselines without semantic input or those integrated with BERT. The main contributions encapsulate:  - We propose LLaMA-VITS model that utilizes the semantic understanding and expression capabilities of LLaMA2 (2023), offering equal or superior acoustic performance compared to baseline models, along with a significantly enhanced ability to understand and express semantics and emotions. - Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate that global tokens in ==LLaMA-VITS== provide more significant improvements than sequential to kens, contrasting with observations in BERT-based TTS models. - We quantitatively verified our findings using both subjective and objective metrics.

Traditional TTS systems, e.g., a Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis (SPSS) system (Taylor, 2009), usually comprise multiple distinct components. These include a frontend module that converts text into linguistic features (such as duration and pitch), an acoustic model that maps these linguistic features to acoustic features, and a vocoder responsible for generating speech waveforms from the acoustic features. Over the past decades, the complexity of traditional models has been notable, attributed to their reliance on manually engineered features and the intricate communication between modules.</p> <p>Transitioning from Hidden Markov Models (HMM) based models (Black et al., 2007), through Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models (Zen et al., 2013), to Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based models (Saito et al., 2017), there has been a no table enhancement in voice quality, yet the architectural complexity remains significant.</p> <p>The advent of end-to-end TTS models marks a significant milestone, increasingly reducing the distinction between synthesized speech and human voice. End-to-end models are capable of trans forming raw text directly into final speech output, which not only streamlines the structural complexity of TTS systems and facilitates easier deployment but also significantly reduces the dependency on manual feature engineering, simplifying the training process. Moreover, they notably enhance the naturalness and intelligibility of the speech, thereby be coming the predominant architecture in TTS models. For instance, Char2Wav (2017) introduces an attentive encoder-decoder frame work for direct speech synthesis from text input. Tacotron (2017) undertakes training from the ground up and directly predicts linear spectrograms. Furthermore, the speech produced by Tacotron2 (2017) closely mirrors the natural human voice.</p> <p>In the realm of end-to-end TTS models, many have adopted a non-autoregressive architecture. This architecture enables parallel data processing, where the model\u2019s output generation does not depend on the output of the previous time step, thereby enhancing processing speed. It also circumvents the error accumulation issue inherent in traditional autoregressive models, which significantly boosts TTS performance. FastSpeech (2019) and its variants exemplify this trend. FastSpeech (2019) employs a transformer-based architecture to generate mel-spectrograms in parallel. Building on FastSpeech (2019), FastPitch (2020) predicts pitch contours during inference, enabling the production of more expressive and high quality speech. FastSpeech2 (2020) further incorporates explicit duration prediction and introduces pitch and energy as conditional inputs.</p> <p>Previous non-autoregressive approaches typically involve distinct training phases for acoustic models and vocoders. VITS (2021) introduces a more natural-sounding output compared to these two-stage systems through its one-stage parallel end-to-end architecture. Innovatively, VITS (2021) incorporates variational inference combined with normalizing flows and employs an adversarial training methodology.

While previous work based on large language models (LLMs) shows impressive performance on zero-shot TTS, such methods often suffer from poor robustness, such as unstable prosody (weird pitch and rhythm/duration) and a high word error rate (WER), due to the autoregressive prediction style of language models. The core idea behind ==RALL-E== is chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes the task into simpler steps to enhance the robustness of LLM-based TTS. To accomplish this idea, ==RALL-E== first predicts prosody features (pitch and duration) of the input text and uses them as intermediate conditions to predict speech tokens in a CoT style. Second, ==RALL-E== utilizes the predicted duration prompt to guide the computing of self-attention weights in Transformer to enforce the model to focus on the corresponding phonemes and prosody features when predicting speech tokens. Results of comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that, compared to a powerful baseline method VALL-E (2023), ==RALL-E== significantly improves the WER of zero-shot TTS from 6.3% (without reranking) and 2.1% (with reranking) to 2.8% and 1.0%, respectively.

With a sufficient model size LLMs emerge powerful in-context learning abilities that can handle unseen tasks with a text instruction (usually called prompt) in a zero-shot or few-shot manner [31]. Moreover, the simple yet effective next-token prediction task of LLMs makes it easy to apply LLMs on other fields, such as vision [5] and speech synthesis [29], as long as the data can be converted to discrete speech tokens. This work focuses on the language modeling of text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. Recent work [14,29] have shown that TTS can be modeled by a decoder-only language model by using a neural codec [4,34] to convert continuous waveforms into discrete tokens. These methods, typically leverage tens of thousands of hours of speech data, emerge in-context learning ability that can clone a speaker\u2019s voice by providing a short audio prompt to the language model, and thus have impressive performance on zero-shot TTS. However, due to the sequential generation property of language models, such codec language models suffer from poor robustness. Although the AutoRegressive (AR) prediction style of language models enables the model to generate speech with diverse prosody patterns, they can also cause bad cases with unnatural prosody. Moreover, since there is no strict alignment between text and speech, the models can omit or repeat words in the input text. This is quite different from TTS methods based on Non-AutoRegressive (NAR) generative models [12,16,25], which predicts all tokens at the same time, thus have high robustness but relatively low diversity. As suggested by previous work [12,33], LLM-based TTS have a higher Word Error Rate (WER) than NAR TTS even if they have similar performance on other metrics. To alleviate this problem, a simple but effective method is to sample the same input text multiple times and select the best one [14,33]. However, such a reranking method further increases the inference time. In this paper, we present ==RALL-E== (the abbreviation of Robust VALL-E), a method to improve the robustness of LLM-based TTS. The core idea of ==RALL-E== is inspired from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [32]. In CoT prompting, the LLM is instructed to generate an intermediate result that is used as a condition for the prediction of the final result. The CoT prompting breaks a complex task into several simpler steps, so that can improve the robustness of LLMs, especially on hard tasks like arithmetic [32]. To adapt CoT prompting to LLM-based TTS, ==RALL-E== predicts prosody tokens (pitch and duration) before predicting speech tokens to stabilize the prosody. Given an input sentence, ==RALL-E== first predicts phoneme-level pitch and duration of the input, then predicts speech tokens conditioning on both the input phonemes and the predicted prosody tokens. Furthermore, ==RALL-E== utilizes the predicted duration to mask irrelevant phonemes and prosody tokens when computing self-attention weights, so that the codec language model is enforced to concentrate on tokens around the phoneme and prosody token the speech token corresponds to. We use VALL-E (2023) [29], a recent powerful LLM-based TTS method, as the baseline, and conduct experiments on a large dataset with 44K hours speech data. Results of comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that RALL significantly improves the robustness of LLM-based TTS by reducing the WER on the LibriSpeech [18] test-clean set from6.3%(w/o reranking) and2.1%(with reranking) to2.8%and 1.0%, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of ==RALL-E== on 50 particularly hard sentences. As demonstrated in Tab.01, compared to VALL-E (2023), ==RALL-E== significantly reduces WER from68%to4%by eliminating almost all types of error, which demonstrates the superior robustness of ==RALL-E== (see Section 4.4 for more details). The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:  - We present ==RALL-E==, a robust codec language modeling method with chain-of-thought prompting for TTS. ==RALL-E== improves the robustness of LLM-based TTS by (1) incorporating prosody tokens as chain-of-thought prompting to stabilize the generation of speech tokens and (2) using duration-guided masking to enhance the alignment between phoneme and speech tokens. - We conduct comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that ==RALL-E== obtains significantly better robustness than the baseline VALL-E (2023) and two previous works. - We further evaluate ==RALL-E== on sentences that are particularly hard to synthesize for LLM-based TTS. The results demonstrate that ==RALL-E== correctly synthesizes hard sentences and reduces the error rate from68%to4%compared to VALL-E (2023), which closely approaches the performance of non-autoregressive TTS.

In such models, text and speech tokens are concatenated together and fed to a single transformer. The whole model is trained on a next-token prediction task like a language model. The LLM-based TTS systems are typically trained on tens of thousands of hours of speech data and have hundreds of millions of parameters, hence can leverage the emergent abilities of LLMs like in-context learning [31] to enable zero-shot TTS (VALL-E (2023)). Besides, recent works (AudioPalM (2023); VioLA (2023); UniAudio (2023)) have shown the decoder-only architecture can be used to learn multiple tasks, as the input and output are processed jointly by a language model, and the model can be signaled to generate results for different tasks by inputting pre-defined special tokens. ==RALL-E== focuses on the robustness problem of LLM-based TTS.</p> <p>\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u83b7\u5f97\u7075\u611f, \u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u5e76\u5f00\u59cb\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u6709 Transformer \u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u67b6\u6784. \u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\u4e32\u8054\u8d77\u6765, \u8f93\u5165\u5230\u5355\u4e2a Transformer \u4e2d. \u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3, \u5982\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u6837. \u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5343\u5c0f\u65f6\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684, \u5177\u6709\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570, \u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b, \u5982\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60, \u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210. \u9664\u6b64\u4e4b\u5916, \u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c [22,30,33] \u8868\u660e, \u4ec5\u6709\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1, \u56e0\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u7531\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u8d77\u5904\u7406\u7684, \u5e76\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ed3\u679c. ==RALL-E== \u7740\u91cd\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5065\u58ee\u6027\u95ee\u9898.</p>","tags":["\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe_CoT","\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b_LLM","\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210_TTS","\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668_Codec"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/2024.04_RALL-E/2024.04_RALL-E/#robust-autoregressive-tts","title":"Robust Autoregressive TTS","text":"<p>The robustness of AR TTS is a popular topic in the literature. For encoder-decoder AR TTS, several previous works enforce the attention weights to be monotonic [2,9, 36] that can effectively improve the robustness. In addition, Shen et al.[24] proposed a non-attentive Tacotron, in which the attention module was replaced by a duration predictor to determine the alignment path before decoding. For decoder-only TTS, a key difference is that the attention weights are computed on text and context at the same time, hence the whole attention weights should not be monotonic. Song et al. proposed ELLA-V (2024) that interleaves the speech tokens with phonemes by inserting a phoneme token and a special End Of Phone(EOP) token at the beginning and end of the speech tokens corresponding to the phoneme, respectively. While the inserted phoneme and the EOP token indicate the duration of each phoneme, such an implicit way entangles the prediction of speech tokens and duration together. ==RALL-E== disentangles the predictions of duration and speech tokens by predicting the duration of all phonemes before the speech tokens, hence has higher controllability over the generation process. Du et al. proposed VALL-T (2024) that uses an unsupervised transducer loss [7] to implicitly model the duration of phonemes. Compared to RALL-E, although VALL-T doesn\u2019t rely on external alignment tools during training, its training time is considerably decelerated since the transducer loss requires the model to perform a forward process for every phoneme.

The distributions of the prosody tokens are modeled together with speech tokens by a single Transformer so that they can influence the duration and pitch of the predicted speech tokens. To further utilize the predicted duration to guide the generation and improve the robustness, we propose duration-guided masking to enhance the alignment between speech tokens, phonemes, and prosody tokens learned by the language model. At each decoding step of the speech tokens, ==RALL-E== masks phonemes and prosody tokens that are irrelevant to the synthesis of the current speech token based on the duration information.

Readers are recommended to refer to the original paper for more details.</p> <p>Generally, VALL-E (2023) is a decoder-only LLM-based TTS system that uses two Transformers [28] to predict speech tokens from the text. The speech tokens here are extracted from EnCodec (2022), a neural audio codec based on residual vector quantization (RVQ) [34] that can convert continuous speech signal into discrete tokens. After predicting the discrete tokens, the waveforms can be reconstructed by feeding the tokens into the decoder of EnCodec. An RVQ typically contains $N$ quantization layers ($N = 8$ in VALL-E (2023)), hence at each time step the encoded speech has $N$ tokens.  Formally, given speech $\\mathbf{y}$ and its transcription $\\mathbf{x}$, the discrete speech token matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ encoded by the codec has a shape of $T \\times N$, where $T$ is the total time step. In addition tox, to clone a speaker\u2019s voice and utilize the in-context learning ability of LLMs, VALL-E (2023) receives a short prompt $\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}}^{T'\\times N}$ as input before predicting $\\mathbf{C}$. Hence, VALL-E (2023) models and maximizes the following distribution:</p> <p>$$   \\mathbb{P}(\\mathbf{C}|\\mathbf{x},\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}}).\\tag{1} $$</p> <p>VALL-E (2023) predicts speech tokens hierarchically where the speech tokens of the 1st layer of RVQ are first predicted by an AR Transformer, and the tokens of the rest layers are predicted by a NAR Transformer. This is because RVQ uses a residual quantization method, i.e. higher layers encode the information that is not encoded by the lower layers, hence tokens of the1st layer contain most information of the waveforms, and the information encoded by the rest layers gradually decreases. The AR Transformer takes the phoneme sequence $\\mathbf{x}$, and speech tokens of the1st layer of the prompt $\\tilde{c}{:,1}$ as input to predict the target speech tokens of the1st layer $\\mathbf{c}{:,1}$ sequentially, i.e. maximizes the following distribution:</p> <p>$$   \\mathbb{P}(\\mathbf{c}{:,1}|\\mathbf{x},\\tilde{\\mathbf{c}}{:,1};\\theta_{AR})=\\prod_{t=1}^T\\mathbb{P}(\\mathbf{c}{t,1}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{c}{&lt;t,1},\\tilde{\\mathbf{c}}{:,1};\\theta{AR}),\\tag{2} $$</p> <p>where $\\theta_{\\text{AR}}$ is the trainable parameters of the AR Transformer. The NAR Transformer predicts all target speech tokens $\\mathbf{c}{:,j}$ of the $j$-th layer at the same time with the phoneme sequence $\\mathbf{x}$, the prompt $\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}}$, and target speech tokens $\\mathbf{c}{:,&lt;j}$ of all layers less than $j$ as the conditions, i.e. maximizes the following distribution:</p> <p>$$   \\mathbb{P}(\\mathbf{c}{:,2:N}|\\mathbf{x},\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}};\\theta{NAR})=\\prod_{j=2}^N\\mathbb{P}(\\mathbf{c}{:,j}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{c}{:,&lt;j},\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}};\\theta_{NAR}),\\tag{3} $$</p> <p>where $\\theta_{\\text{NAR}}$ is the trainable parameters of the NAR Transformer. By combining Eq.2 and Eq.3, VALL-E (2023) breaks Eq.1 into the following form:</p> <p>$$   \\mathbb{P}(\\mathbf{C}|\\mathbf{x},\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}})=\\mathbb{P}(\\mathbf{c}{:,1}|\\mathbf{x},\\tilde{\\mathbf{c}}{:,1};\\theta_{AR})\\mathbb{P}(\\mathbf{c}{:,2:N}|\\mathbf{x},\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}};\\theta{NAR}).\\tag{4} $$</p> <p>It is noteworthy that in practice the two Transformers have the same architecture but have different attention masks during computation. Specifically, both the two Transformers use a bidirectional mask for the phoneme sequence $\\mathbf{x}$, which means every phoneme $x_i$ can attend to all other phonemes $x_{\\neq i}$. However, for the speech tokens, the AR Transformers uses a unidirectional mask so that $\\mathbf{c}{t,1}$ can only attend to previous tokens $\\mathbf{c}{&lt;t,1}$, while the NAR Transformer still uses a bidirectional mask.</p>","tags":["\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe_CoT","\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b_LLM","\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210_TTS","\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668_Codec"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/2024.04_RALL-E/2024.04_RALL-E/#32prosody-tokens-as-chain-of-thought-prompts","title":"3.2.Prosody Tokens as Chain-of-Thought Prompts","text":"<p>One of the problems of LLM-based TTS is that it directly generates speech from phonemes with no restriction on the prosody, e.g. pitch, duration, etc, which usually results in speech with unstable prosody. A similar problem is also observed in Wei et al.[32] where the authors find LLMs cannot directly answer a complex question like arithmetic and propose CoT prompting to solve this problem. The idea of CoT prompting is breaking a complex task into several simpler tasks so that LLMs can utilize the intermediate results to reach the final answers. As shown in Wei et al.[32], by CoT prompting the correct rate of LLMs on complex tasks can be significantly improved.

We define the window size ask, thus each speech token can attend on $2k + 1$ phonemes and $2k + 1$ prosody tokens. All phonemes and prosody tokens at other positions will be masked out, hence their attention weights are always zero. When $k = 0$ the speech token strictly attends to the phoneme it corresponds to. If the alignment is perfect this should be enough. However, in the experiments, we found that the alignment results obtained by our alignment tool usually have errors. We thus loosen the restriction by also allowing the speech token to attend at the near phonemes of the corresponding phoneme. Another reason for this design is that the pronunciation of a phoneme is usually dependent on near phonemes.

Contemporary text-to-speech (TTS) models possess the capability to generate speech of exceptionally high quality, closely mimicking human speech. Nevertheless, given the wide array of applications now employing TTS models, mere high-quality speech generation is no longer sufficient.  Present-day TTS models must also excel at producing expressive speech that can convey various speaking styles and emotions, akin to human speech. Consequently,researchers have concentrated their efforts on developing more efficient models for expressive speech synthesis in recent years. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on expressive speech synthesis models published within the last 5 years, with a particular emphasis on approaches based on deep learning. We offer a comprehensive classification scheme for these models and provide concise descriptions of models falling into each category. Additionally, we summarize the principal challenges encountered in this research domain and outline the strategies employed to tackle these challenges as documented in the literature.

This progress has followed a path consisting of several stages, beginning with conventional methods named as concatenative synthesis and progressing to more advanced approaches known as statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS). Advanced approaches are mainly based on machine learning algorithms like hidden Markov models (HMMs) and gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Despite this progress, speech generated by these methods was still noticeably artificial. However, the emergence of deep learning (DL) as a new branch under machine learning (ML) in 2006 has led to significant improvements. Speech synthesis researchers,like many in other research fields, started incorporating deep neural networks (DNN) in their models. Initially,DNNs replaced HMMs and GMMs in SPSS models while the main structure still follows the primary framework of SPSS models as shown in Fig. 1. As discussed in \"Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis Using Deep Neural Networks\", the deep learning-based models have overcome many limitations and problems associated with machine learning-based models.</p> <p>Researchers continue to aim for improved speech quality and more human-like speech despite past advancements. Additionally, they seek to simplify the framework of the text-to-speech models due to the intricate nature of the SPSS structure, which limits progress in this field to those with extensive linguistic knowledge and expertise. Deep learning advancements have brought about the simple encoder-decoder structure for TTS models as sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) approaches. The pro-posed approaches have simplified the structure of conventional TTS with multiple components into training a single network that converts a set of input text characters/phonemes into a set of acoustic features (mel-spectrograms). A main concern in these advanced TTS models is the mapping process between the input and output sequences, which is a one-to-many problem, as the single input text can have multiple speech variations as output. In fact, there are two groups of recent TTS models, as shown in Fig. 2. The first group generates mel-spectrograms in a sequential (autoregressive) manner using soft and automatic attention alignments between input and output sequences, such as the Tacotron model (Tacotron Tacotron2). The second group utilizes hard alignments between the phonemes/characters and mel-spectro-grams, and thus its speech generation process is parallel(non-autoregressive), as in the FastSpeech model (FastSpeech FastSpeech2).This improvement in the structure of the TTS model has encouraged rapid development in the field within the last few years, during which the proposed models produced speech that is nearly indistinguishable from human speech.</p> <p>Human speech is highly expressive and reflects various factors, such as the speaker\u2019s identity, emotion, and speaking style. In addition, there are many applications in which speech synthesis can be utilized, especially expressive speech synthesis. For instance, audiobooks and podcast applications that create audio versions of eBooks and podcasts, translation applications which provide real-time translation of foreign language text, dubbing applications that generate an alternative audio track for a video with different content, speaker, or language, and content creation applications which help produce audio versions of textual content, such as blogs and news articles. E-learning applications that allow for adding voice-over audio to e-learning courses, and conversational AI applications enable machines to communicate with users in a human-like manner, such as AI chatbots and virtual assistants.</p> <p>As spoken language is a crucial component in such applications, users must feel as if they are communicating with a real human rather than a machine. Therefore, the speech generated by these applications should convey appropriate emotion, intonation, stress, and speaking style to match the ongoing conversation or the content type and context of the text being read.</p> <p>As a result, there has been a recent attention towards building efficient expressive speech synthesis models as another step forward in achieving human-like speech. Therefore, many studies have been devoted to expressive speech synthesis (ETTS) as a hot research area, particularly over the last 5 years. In this work, we present the findings of our systematic literature review on ETTS field from the past 5 years. Firstly, we suggest a classification schema of deep learning-based ETTS models that are proposed during this period, based on structures,and learning methods followed in each study. A summary is then provided for each category in the classifi-cation schema and main papers related to this category. After that, we outline the main challenges in the ETTS area and solutions that have been proposed to solve them from literature. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our work and a highlight of some gaps that require further research in this area.</p> <p>During our work on this review of expressive speech synthesis literature, we came across several review papers that focus on different stages of development in the speech synthesis field. The majority of these reviews concentrate on DL-based TTS approaches, while only a few papers cover recent TTS approaches in addition to early conventional ones. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no review papers that cover the fast growth in the (expressive) speech synthesis area, especially in the last few years. Therefore, our main goal in this review is to provide an overview of research trends, techniques, and challenges in this area during this period. We hope that our work will offer researchers a comprehensive understanding of how and what has been accomplished in this field and the gaps that need to be filled as guidance for their future efforts.</p> <p>While we were writing this paper, we came across an interesting recent review paper \"An Overview of Affective Speech Synthesis and Conversion in the Deep Learning Era\" that is similar to our work. However, the review covers emotional speech synthesis (ESS) as a sub-field of voice transformation while our work is more comprehensive as a systematic literature review that discusses approaches,challenges, and resources. Furthermore, the taxonomy we provide for the reviewed approaches differs from the one given in as elaborated in the next section.</p> <p>The remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides an explanation of the methodology employed for conducting this review. Sections 3and 4 describe the different main and sub-categories of the proposed classification schema for DL-based expressive TTS models. Main challenges facing ETTS models and how they have been tackled in the literature are covered in Section 5. We then give a brief description of ETTS datasets and applied evaluation metrics in Sec-tions 6 and 7, respectively. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper.</p>","tags":["\u7efc\u8ff0","\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210","\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u97f3"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/Survey/DL-Based_Expressive_Speech_Synthesis/#2","title":"2.\u65b9\u6cd5","text":"<p>The last few years have seen rapid growth in expressive and emotional speech synthesis approaches, resulting in a large number of papers and publications in this area.

From our observation, most of the proposed methods in the last 5 years are based on three main early works in this field, namely, reference encoder [74], global style tokens[75], and latent features via variational autoencoders (VAE)[76] [77]. Specifically, proposed models in most of the papers under this category can be considered as an extension or enhancement of one of the three previously mentioned methods. Besides, we identify a fourth subcategory that includes the recent TTS models representing the new trend in the TTS area, which utilizes in-context learning. There is one factor common to all these four unsupervised models,which is that they are all based on using an audio reference/prompt.

Those labels guide model training, enabling it to learn accurate weights. Early deep learning-based expressive speech synthesis systems were primarily supervised models that utilized labeled speech exhibiting various emotions (such as sadness, happiness, and anger) or speaking styles (such as talk-show, newscaster, and call-center). Note that the term style has also been used to refer to a set of emotions or a mixture of emotions and speaking styles (ST-TTS, [68] [78] [79].  Generally, the structure of early conventional TTS models was built upon two primary networks: one for predicting duration and the other for predicting acoustic features. These acoustic features were then converted to speech using vocoders. Both networks receive linguistic features extracted from the input text.  In supervised ETTS approaches, speech labels (emotions and/or styles) are represented in the TTS model as either input features or as separate layers, models, or sets of neurons for each specific label.

Therefore, the three one-hot vectors representing the given three labels are combined and passed as input to an embedding layer to reduce its dimension (in this case 15).

In the context of N emotion classes, each sample from the talker may be perceived by the listener as one of the N emotions. In response to this, the paper suggests the adoption of a singular vector termed the \u2019perception vector,\u2019 with N dimensions. This vector represents how samples from a specific emotion class are distributed among the N emotions, based on the listener\u2019s perception. Furthermore, in the context of multiple listeners, each emotion class can be represented as a confusion matrix that captures the diverse perceptions of samples belonging to that emotion class by multiple listeners.</p> <p>\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6ce8\u91ca\u60c5\u611f\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u503e\u542c\u8005\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5dee\u5f02, \u6587\u732e [66] \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5. \u5728\u5177\u6709 N \u4e2a\u60c5\u7eea\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b, \u6765\u81ea\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u503e\u542c\u8005\u611f\u77e5\u4e3a\u8fd9 $N$ \u4e2a\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u5176\u4e2d\u4e4b\u4e00. \u5bf9\u6b64, \u6587\u732e [66] \u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u6837\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\"\u611f\u77e5\u5411\u91cf\"\u7684\u5355\u4e2a N \u7ef4\u5411\u91cf. \u8fd9\u4e00\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u7eea\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5982\u4f55\u6839\u636e\u503e\u542c\u8005\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5728 N \u4e2a\u60c5\u7eea\u4e0a\u5206\u5e03. \u6b64\u5916, \u5728\u591a\u503e\u542c\u8005\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b, \u6bcf\u4e2a\u60c5\u7eea\u7c7b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635, \u6355\u83b7\u7531\u591a\u4e2a\u503e\u542c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8be5\u60c5\u7eea\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5.</p>","tags":["\u7efc\u8ff0","\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210","\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u97f3"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/Survey/DL-Based_Expressive_Speech_Synthesis/#32-labels-as-separate-layersmodels","title":"3.2 Labels as Separate Layers/Models \u6807\u7b7e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u72ec\u5c42/\u6a21\u578b","text":"<p>In this approach, to represent emotion or style labels in TTS models, each label is associated with either a separate instance of the DNN model, an emotion-specific layers, or a set of emotion-specific neurons within a layer. Initially, the model is trained using neutral data, which typically has larger size. Subsequently, in the first approach, multiple copies of the trained model are fine-tuned using emotion-specific data of small size [43] [78]. In the second approach, instead of creating an individual model for each emotion, only specific model layers (usually the uppermost or final layers) from the employed DNN model are assigned to each emotion [43] [65] [69] [78] as shown by Fig. 5. While shared layers are adjusted during training using neutral data, output layers corresponding to each emotion are modified exclusively when the model is trained with data from the respective emotion.</p> <p>\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d, TTS \u6a21\u578b\u5185\u4e3a\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u60c5\u611f\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u6807\u7b7e, \u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8981\u4e48\u548c DNN \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u72ec\u793a\u4f8b\u5373\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u611f\u5c42, \u8981\u4e48\u548c\u4e00\u5c42\u5185\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u611f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u96c6\u5408\u76f8\u5173\u8054.  \u9996\u5148, \u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u5e38\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u4e2d\u6027\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3.  \u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5, \u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u5df2\u7ecf\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u526f\u672c\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u611f\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03;  \u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5, \u4e0d\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u521b\u5efa\u5355\u72ec\u6a21\u578b, \u800c\u662f\u53ea\u5c06\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684 DNN \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42 (\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u6700\u4e0a\u5c42/\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42) \u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6bcf\u79cd\u60c5\u611f. \u5982\u56fe\u4e94\u6240\u793a. \u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6027\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5171\u4eab\u5c42\u4f1a\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574, \u5bf9\u5e94\u6bcf\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u4ec5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5e94\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6539.</p> <p>Alternatively, when dealing with limited data for certain emotions/styles, the model can initially undergo training for emotions with large amount of data.

In this approach, the hidden layers of the model could be expanded by introducing new neurons. Then, as outlined in [81], particular neurons from this expanded set are assigned to represent each distinct emotion. Importantly, the associated weights of these specific neuron subsets are adjusted solely during the processing of data relevant to the corresponding emotion. Furthermore, by substituting the subset of neurons dedicated to a particular emotional class with a different set, the model becomes capable of generating speech imbued with the desired emotional class. This capability holds true even for new speakers who only possess neutral data, and in this case, it is known as expression/emotion transplantation.</p> <p>\u5176\u4ed6\u8868\u793a\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5c06 DNN \u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6bcf\u79cd\u60c5\u611f. \u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u5c42. \u5982\u6587\u732e [81] \u4ece\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u5206\u914d\u7279\u5b9a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6765\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u611f. \u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u5904\u7406\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u60c5\u611f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6570\u636e\u65f6, \u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5b9a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6743\u91cd\u624d\u4f1a\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574. \u6b64\u5916, \u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5165\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u67d0\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143, \u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6240\u9700\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u7684\u8bed\u97f3. \u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u4ec5\u6709\u4e2d\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4e5f\u6210\u7acb, \u8fd9\u79f0\u4e3a\u8868\u8fbe/\u60c5\u611f\u79fb\u690d.</p>","tags":["\u7efc\u8ff0","\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210","\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u97f3"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/Survey/DL-Based_Expressive_Speech_Synthesis/#33-labels-for-emotion-predictorsclassifiers","title":"3.3 Labels for Emotion Predictors/Classifiers \u6807\u7b7e\u7528\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668/\u5206\u7c7b\u5668","text":"<p>Another common approach to utilize emotion labels is to use them directly or via emotion predictor or classifier to support the process of extracting emotion/prosody embedding. </p> <p>\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u6216\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u611f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668/\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u53d6\u60c5\u611f/\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b.</p> <p>For example, in \"End-to-End Emotional Speech Synthesis Using Style Tokens  and Semi-Supervised Training\" emotion labels represented as one-hot vectors are used as targets for the weight vectors of GSTs (explained in Section 4.3) where a cross entropy loss between the two vectors is added to the total loss function.

Initially, the input Mel-spectrogram features from the reference-style audio and those predicted by the proposed TTS model are passed to two reference encoders (explained in Section 4.1) to generate reference embeddings. Both embeddings are then fed to two emotion classifiers, which consist of intermediate fully connected (FC) layers. The output of the second FC layer from both classifiers is considered as the emotion embedding. Apart from the loss of the classifiers, an additional loss function is established between the resulting emotion embeddings from the two classifiers. Similarly, an emotion classifier is also employed in [36] to reduce irrelevant information in the generated emotion embedding from an emotion encoder with reference speech (Mel-spectrogram) as input.</p> <p>\u6587\u732e [32] \u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5177\u6709\u533a\u5206\u6027\u5f97\u60c5\u611f\u5d4c\u5165. \u9996\u5148\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u98ce\u683c\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6885\u5c14\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u548c TTS \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u4f20\u9012\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u5d4c\u5165. \u4e24\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5165\u4e4b\u540e\u90fd\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d, \u7531\u4e2d\u95f4\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u7ec4\u6210. \u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u60c5\u611f\u5d4c\u5165. \u9664\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u635f\u5931\u4e4b\u5916, \u8fd8\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570.  \u6587\u732e [36] \u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u5e26\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u8bed\u97f3 (\u6885\u5c14\u9891\u8c31) \u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f.</p> <p>Several other studies [34] [36] [39] that support multiple speakers also suggest utilizing a speaker classifier in addition to the emotion classifier.

Within these approaches, models are trained to extract speaking styles or emotions from expressive speech data through unsupervised methods. Unsupervised models typically utilize reference speech as an input to the TTS model, which extracts a style or prosody embedding which is then used to synthesize speech resembling the input style reference. In the literature, three primary structures emerge as baseline models for unsupervised ETTS models: including reference encoders, global style tokens, and variational autoencoders, which are explained in the following three sections.

In another study [31], the reference encoder is proposed as a ranking function model, aimed at learning emotion strength at the phoneme level. This model leverages the OpenSMILE toolkit to extract 384-dimensional emotion-related features from segments of reference audio, derived using a forced alignment model for phoneme boundaries.

First, the encoder learns the parameters of the z vectors (latent distribution), namely the mean $\\mu(x)$ and variance $\\sigma^2(x)$, based on the input data x. Second,the decoder regenerates the input data x based on latent vectors z sampled from the distribution learned by the encoder. In addition to the reconstruction loss between the model input and the data, variational autoencoders are also trained to minimize a latent loss, which ensures that the latent space follows a Gaussian distribution.</p> <p>\u5728\u8fd9\u7c7b TTS \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d, \u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5229\u7528 VAE \u5c06\u6765\u81ea\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7ec4\u7ec7\u826f\u597d\u4e14\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4.

The paper proposes a framework to learn various speaking styles (referred to as style tokens) in an unsupervised manner within an end-to-end TTS model. The proposed approach can be seen as a soft clustering method that learns soft style clusters for expressive styles in an unlabeled dataset. In detail, GST, as shown by Fig. 8, extends the approach introduced in [74] by passing the resulting style embedding from the reference encoder to an attention unit,which functions as a similarity measure between the style embedding and a bank of randomly initialized tokens. During training, the model learns the style tokens and a set of weights, where each style embedding is generated via a weighted sum of the learned tokens. In fact, the obtained weights represent how each token contributes to the final style embedding. Therefore, each token will represent a single style or a single prosody-related feature, such as pitch, intensity, or speaking rate. At inference time, a reference audio can be passed to the model to generate its corresponding style embedding via a weighted sum of the style tokens. Alternatively, each individual style token can be used as a style embedding. In addition, GSTs offer an enhanced control over the speaking style through various operations. These include manual weight refinement, token scaling with different values, or the ability to condition different parts of the input text with distinct style tokens.</p> <p>\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u98ce\u683c\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u732e [75] \u4e2d\u88ab\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa. \u8be5\u6587\u732e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef TTS \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ee5\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5404\u79cd\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c (\u79f0\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u6807\u8bb0). \u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6f\u98ce\u683c\u7c07. \u5177\u4f53\u5730 GST \u5982\u56fe\u516b\u6240\u793a, \u5c06\u6587\u732e [74] \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6269\u5c55, \u5c06\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5355\u5143, \u4f5c\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u4e00\u7ec4\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf. \u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6, \u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u98ce\u683c\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u4e00\u7ec4\u6743\u91cd, \u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u83b7\u5f97. \u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a, \u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8d21\u732e. \u56e0\u6b64\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u5355\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u6216\u5355\u4e2a\u97f5\u5f8b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5f81, \u4f8b\u5982\u97f3\u9ad8, \u5f3a\u5ea6\u6216\u8bed\u901f. \u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6, \u53c2\u8003\u97f3\u9891\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5e94\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165. \u6216\u8005\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u6807\u8bb0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165. \u6b64\u5916 GSTs \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63a7\u5236, \u5305\u62ec\u624b\u52a8\u6743\u91cd\u7ec6\u5316, \u6807\u8bb0\u6309\u4e0d\u540c\u503c\u7f29\u653e\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u683c\u6807\u8bb0\u6761\u4ef6\u8bdd\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u5206.</p> <p>The GST-TTS model can be further enhanced by modeling different levels of prosody to improve both expressiveness and control over the generated speech. For instance, [46] proposes a fine-grained GST-TTS model where word-level GSTs are generated to capture local style variations (WSVs) through a prosody extractor. The WSV extractor consists of a reference encoder and a style token layer, as described in [75], along with an attention unit to produce the word-level style token.</p> <p>In [133] a hierarchical structure of multi-layer GSTs with residuals is proposed. The model employs three GST layers, each with 10 tokens, resulting in a better interpretation of the tokens of each level. Upon tokens analysis, it was found that the first-layer tokens learned speaker representations, while the second-layer tokens captured various speaking style features such as pause position, duration, and stress. The third-layer tokens, however, were able to generate higher-quality samples with more distinct and interpretable styles. Similarly, in[50], a multi-scale GST extractor is proposed to extract speaking style at different levels. This extractor extracts style embeddings from the reference mel-spectrogram using three style encoders at global, sentence, and sub word levels, and combines their outputs to form the multi-scale style embedding.</p> <p>GST-TTS \u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236.</p> <ul> <li>\u6587\u732e [46] \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6 GST-TTS \u6a21\u578b, \u901a\u8fc7\u97f5\u5f8b\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u8bcd\u7ea7\u522b\u7684 GSTs \u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u98ce\u683c\u53d8\u5316 (WSVs).

The policy aims to predict the emotional acoustic features at each time step, where these features represent the actions. The pre-trained SER model then provides feedback on the predicted features through emotion recognition accuracy, which represents the reward. The policy gradient strategy is employed to perform backpropagation and optimize the TTS model to achieve the maximum reward.</p> <p>\u6587\u732e [92] \u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b SER \u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u548c GST-TTS \u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u97f3, \u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5f88\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3. \u8be5\u6587\u732e\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60. \u5728\u6b64\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b, GST-TTS \u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53, \u5176\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565. \u7b56\u7565\u65e8\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81, \u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u52a8\u4f5c. \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3 SER \u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988, \u5373\u5956\u52b1. \u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316 TTS \u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u5956\u52b1.</p> <p>In contrast, the Mellotron model [114] introduces a unique structure for the GSTs, enabling Mellotron to generate speech in various styles, including singing styles, based on pitch and duration information extracted from the reference audio.

Similarly, adversarial training is introduced to the style encoder of the cross-speaker emotion transfer model to learn a speaker-independent style embedding, where the target speaker embedding is provided from a separate speaker encoder.</p> <p>\u6709\u51e0\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6216\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u97f3\u9891\u6d41\u52a8\u5230\u751f\u6210\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165. \u4f8b\u5982, VAE-TTS \u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u97f5\u5f8b\u7f16\u7801. \u7528\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5d4c\u5165, \u53c2\u8003\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u8bed\u8c03\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u6885\u5c14\u9891\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\u5316 VAE. \u91c7\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u8f6c\u5c42\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u8026\u97f5\u5f8b\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u548c\u8bed\u8c03. \u7c7b\u4f3c\u5730, \u8de8\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u60c5\u611f\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e5f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165, \u5176\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5d4c\u5165\u7531\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b.</p> <p>The STYLER model employs multiple style encoders to decompose the style reference into several components, including duration, pitch, speaker, energy, and noise.

The proposed model introduces a shared layer between an ASR and a reference encoder-based model.  Specifically, a single BiLSTM layer from the listener module of a pre-trained ASR model serves as the prior layer to the reference encoder.  The process starts by passing the reference Mel-spectrogram to the shared layer to produce the shared embedding as input to both the reference encoder and the ASR model.  A Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) is employed by the ASR model to reverse its gradient on the shared layer.  Accordingly, the reference encoder parameters are modified so that the ASR model fails to recognize the shared embedding, and thus content leakage to the style embedding from the reference encoder is reduced.</p> <p>\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762, \u6587\u732e 102 \u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u8f6c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u98ce\u683c\u53c2\u8003\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3. \u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728 ASR \u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u5c42. \u5177\u4f53\u5730, \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3 ASR \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u542c\u4f17\u6a21\u5757\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u4e2a BiLSTM \u5c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u524d\u4e00\u5c42. \u5c06\u53c2\u8003\u6885\u5c14\u9891\u8c31\u4f20\u9012\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u5c42\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165, \u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c ASR \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u5165.

Similarly, in paper [39], a model with two encoders and two classifiers is proposed to produce disentangled embeddings for speakers and emotions from a reference audio.  However, the paper claims that some emotional information is lost during the process of disentangling speaker identity from the emotion embedding.  As a result, an ASR model is introduced to compensate for the missing emotional information.  The emotion embedding is incorporated within a pre-trained ASR model through a Global Context (GC) block.  This block extracts global emotional features from the ASR model\u2019s intermediate features (AIF).  Subsequently, a prosody compensation encoder is utilized to generate emotion compensation information from the output of the AIF layer, which is then added to the emotion encoder output.</p> <p>\u5728\u6587\u732e [36] \u4e2d, \u9664\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e4b\u5916, \u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u97f3\u9891\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u5d4c\u5165. \u4e3a\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89e3\u8026\u60c5\u611f, \u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f, \u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u90fd\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u652f\u6301, \u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e. \u7c7b\u4f3c\u5730, \u6587\u732e [39] \u4e2d, \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u97f3\u9891\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5d4c\u5165. \u7136\u800c\u8be5\u6587\u732e\u58f0\u79f0\u518d\u4ece\u60c5\u611f\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6807\u8bc6\u65f6\u4e22\u5931\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u606f. \u56e0\u6b64\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a ASR \u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u8865\u507f\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u606f. \u60c5\u611f\u5d4c\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u6587\u672c\u5757\u88ab\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3 ASR \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d. \u8fd9\u4e2a\u5757\u4ece ASR \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81 (AIF) \u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u60c5\u611f\u7279\u5f81. \u7136\u540e, \u4f7f\u7528\u97f5\u5f8b\u8865\u507f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece AIF \u5c42\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u60c5\u611f\u8865\u507f\u4fe1\u606f, \u4e4b\u540e\u52a0\u5165\u5230\u60c5\u611f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d.</p>","tags":["\u7efc\u8ff0","\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210","\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u97f3"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/Survey/DL-Based_Expressive_Speech_Synthesis/#513-information-bottleneck","title":"5.1.3.\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888 (Information Bottleneck)","text":"<p>The information bottleneck is a technique used to control information flow via a single layer/network.

Several prosody-reference based approaches, as in [86] [93] [97] [101] [130], have employed this technique to prevent the flow of speaker or content-related information from the reference audio to the prosody embedding.</p> <p>\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5c42\u6216\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002 \u5b83\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9632\u6b62\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6295\u5c04\u5230\u8f83\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ece\u800c\u6ca1\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u901a\u8fc7\u5b83\u3002 \u6362\u53e5\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7eaf\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u3002 \u6709\u51e0\u9879\u57fa\u4e8e\u97f5\u5f8b\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u7ecf\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6280\u672f\u7528\u4e8e\u9632\u6b62\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6216\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u97f3\u9891\u6d41\u5165\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u3002</p> <p>In [93], a bottleneck layer named sieve layer is introduced to the style encoder in GST-TTS to generate pure style embedding.

Another example is the cross-speaker-style transfer Transformer-TTS model proposed in [86] with both speaker and style embeddings as input to the model encoder.  The speaker-style-combined output from the encoder is then passed to a prosody bottleneck sub-network, which produces a prosody embedding that involves only prosody-related features.  The proposed bottleneck sub-network consists of two CNN layers, a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block [152], and a linear layer.

The model applies three techniques to disentangle the source speaker information from the prosody embedding.  One of these techniques is to use a temporal bottleneck encoder [153] within the reference encoder of the model.  The prosody embedding that is sampled from the latent space is passed to the bottleneck to reduce speaker identity-related information in the prosody embedding before it flows to the model decoder. Similarly, the model proposed in [101] produces a style embedding with less irrelevant style information by adding a variational information bottleneck (VIB) [154] layer to the reference encoder.  The idea behind this layer is to introduce a complexity constraint on mutual information(MI) between the reference encoder input and output so that it only flows out style-related information.</p> <ul> <li>\u6587\u732e 130 \u63d0\u51fa\u7684 Copycat TTS \u662f\u901a\u8fc7 VAE \u8fdb\u884c\u97f5\u5f8b\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6a21\u578b. \u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u6765\u4ece\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u6e90\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f. \u5176\u4e2d\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u74f6\u9888\u7f16\u7801\u5668 \u6587\u732e 153, \u5728\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e4b\u524d, \u4ece\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u88ab\u4f20\u9012\u5230\u74f6\u9888\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5176\u4e2d\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f.</li> <li>\u6587\u732e 101 \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed9\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6dfb\u52a0\u53d8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888 (Variational Information Bottleneck, VIB) \u5c42\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c11\u98ce\u683c\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165. \u8be5\u5c42\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u4f7f\u5176\u53ea\u6d41\u51fa\u98ce\u683c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f.</li> </ul>","tags":["\u7efc\u8ff0","\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210","\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u97f3"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/Survey/DL-Based_Expressive_Speech_Synthesis/#514-instance-normalization","title":"5.1.4.\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316 (Instance Normalization)","text":"<p>Batch normalization (BN), first introduced in [155], is utilized in deep neural networks to accelerate the training process and increase its stability.

In the field of computer vision, stylization approach is significantly improved by replacing (BN) layers with (IN) layers [156].  Consequently, researchers in the expressive speech field have started to apply IN to extract better prosody representations.

Two variations from the R\u00e9nyi divergence family are proposed, including minimizing the Hellinger distance and minimizing the sum of R\u00e9nyi divergences.</p> <p>\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf, \u4e92\u4fe1\u606f (Mutual Information, MI) \u88ab\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u4fe1\u606f. \u5177\u4f53\u5730, \u82e5 $X$ \u548c $Y$ \u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf, \u90a3\u4e48 $MI(X;Y)$ \u5982\u56fe\u5341\u663e\u793a\u7684\u97e6\u6069\u56fe\u6240\u793a, \u53ef\u4ee5\u89c6\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03 $P_{XY}$ \u548c\u8fb9\u9645\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03 $(P_X,P_Y)$ \u7684\u4e58\u79ef\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684 KL \u6563\u5ea6. \u82e5\u4e24\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf $X$ \u548c $Y$ \u5206\u522b\u8868\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u5411\u91cf, \u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5411\u91cf\u5e94\u7528\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c11\u6765\u81ea\u5185\u5bb9\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5411\u91cf. $$     MI(X;Y)=DL_{KL}(P_{(X,Y)}| P_X\\otimes P_Y),\\tag{2} $$</p> <ul> <li>\u6587\u732e [137] \u5c06\u6587\u732e [157] \u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7f51\u7edc\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5 (Mutual Information Neural Estimation, MINE) \u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5185\u5bb9\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f. \u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc, \u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0b\u754c. \u540c\u65f6, TTS \u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u635f\u5931, \u4f7f\u5f97\u6574\u4f53\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u6700\u5927-\u6700\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898.</li> <li>\u6587\u732e [021] \u5c06\u6587\u732e [158] \u4f7f\u7528 CLUB \u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0a\u754c\u4f5c\u4e3a MI \u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf, \u7528\u4e8e\u9632\u6b62\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d.</li> <li>\u6587\u732e [117] \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e VAE \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5bb9/\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d. \u901a\u5e38\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u4f30\u8ba1\u9690\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba/\u5185\u5bb9\u5d4c\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f. \u4e3a\u4e86\u907f\u514d\u6709\u9650\u91c7\u6837\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5176\u7684\u6307\u6570\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee, \u4f5c\u8005\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u6563\u5ea6, \u540d\u4e3a R\u00e9nyi \u6563\u5ea6.

Figure 11 illustrates the framework of the wav2vec technique and how it is utilized as a feature extractor with TTS models. The wav2vec model converts the continuous audio features into quantized finite set of discrete representations called tokens. This is done using a quantization module that maps the continuous feature vectors into a discrete set of tokens from a learned codebook. As those tokens are more abstract, they reduce the complexity of the features by retaining important features while filtering out all the irrelevant information. Because of that abstraction, it is harder to reconstruct audio from the wav2vec features, which means leakage of linguistic content into feature vectors is significantly lower compared to other features such as MFCCs.</p> <p>\u4e00\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528 Wav2Vec 2.0 \u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668, \u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f93\u5165, \u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u539f\u59cb\u97f3\u9891\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81. \u56fe\u5341\u4e00\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 Wac2Vec \u6280\u672f\u53ca\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e TTS \u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408.

However, prosody references are not always available for the desired speaker, style, or text. Besides, using prosody reference introduces the leakage problem as discussed in Section 5.1. As a result, different techniques have been proposed that enable unsupervised expressive speech synthesis without prosody references. Some techniques utilize the reference audio at training phase while at inference phase speech synthesis can be done with or without a reference audio. Other techniques depend on input text only to generate prosody embedding at both training and inference phases.

Regarding the improvement of the baseline structure, study [68] suggests the combination of multiple variational autoencoders to generate latent variables at three distinct levels: utterance-level, phrase-level, and word-level. Furthermore, they apply a conditional prior (CP) to learn the latent space distribution based on the input text embedding. To account for dependencies within the input text, they employ Autoregressive (AR) latent converters to transform latent variables from coarser to finer levels. An alternative approach is proposed in [126] by replacing the conventional VAE encoder with a residual encoder that leverages phoneme embedding and a set of learnable free parameters as inputs. With this modified structure, the model learns a latent distribution that represents various prosody styles for a specific sentence (i.e.,the input text), in addition to capturing potential global biases within the applied dataset (represented by the free parameters). At the same time, with this modification, the problem of speaker and content leakage into prosody embedding is addressed.</p> <p>\u5176\u4ed6\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898, \u5bfb\u6c42\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u5411\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b. \u5173\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6539\u8fdb: - \u6587\u732e [068] \u5efa\u8bae\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9690\u53d8\u91cf: \u8bed\u8c03\u7ea7, \u77ed\u8bed\u7ea7\u548c\u5355\u8bcd\u7ea7. \u6b64\u5916\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u5148\u9a8c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03. \u4e3a\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u5185\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027, \u4ed6\u4eec\u5e94\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9690\u8f6c\u5316\u5668\u5c06\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u4ece\u7c97\u7cd9\u7ea7\u522b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ea7\u522b. - \u6587\u732e [126] \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5, \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf VAE \u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u97f3\u7d20\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u4e00\u7ec4\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7531\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f16\u7801\u5668. \u91c7\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784, \u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u53e5\u5b50\u5373\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u9690\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u793a\u5404\u79cd\u97f5\u5f8b\u98ce\u683c, \u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u5dee (\u7531\u81ea\u7531\u53c2\u6570\u8868\u793a). \u540c\u65f6\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u6cc4\u9732\u5230\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e5f\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u51b3.</p> <p>Various studies propose training a predictor for the latent prosody vectors based on features extracted from the input text [35] [47]. The proposed model in [47] generates fine-grained prosody latent codes of three dimensions at phoneme-level. These prosody codes are then used to guide the training process of a prosody predictor that receives phoneme embeddings as input, in addition to emotion and speaker embeddings as sentence-level conditions. In [35], the predicted mean values of the latent space distribution are employed as prosody codes. Similarly, a prosody predictor is trained to predict these prosody codes using two text-based inputs, including sentence-level embeddings from a pre-trained BERT model and contextual information considering BERT embeddings of a few of surrounding k sentences given the current sentence.</p> <p>\u591a\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u9690\u97f5\u5f8b\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5668. - \u6587\u732e [047] \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u522b\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u97f5\u5f8b\u9690\u4ee3\u7801. \u8fd9\u4e9b\u97f5\u5f8b\u4ee3\u7801\u4e4b\u540e\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u97f5\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3. \u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u63a5\u6536\u97f3\u7d20\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165, \u6b64\u5916\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u6761\u4ef6. - \u6587\u732e [035] \u4e2d\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5747\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u97f5\u5f8b\u7f16\u7801. \u7c7b\u4f3c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u97f5\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5305\u62ec\u6765\u81ea\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3 BERT \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u8003\u8651\u5f53\u524d\u53e5\u5b50\u5468\u56f4\u7684 k \u4e2a\u53e5\u5b50\u7684 BERT \u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u97f5\u5f8b\u7f16\u7801.</p> <p>Alternatively, study [129] proposed training a sampler, i.e., Gaussian parameters, to sample the latent space using features extracted from the input text.

Additionally, style embeddings from previous sentences are integrated into the fusion context encoder input to account for speech-side information.</p> <p>\u6587\u732e\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668, \u8003\u8651\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4fa7\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u4fa7\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u4fe1\u606f. \u8fd9\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ec4\u4ef6: \u4e00\u4e2a\u53e5\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u878d\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\u7f16\u7801\u5668. \u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u5305\u62ec XLNet \u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u53e5\u5b50\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u8bcd\u7684\u7684\u8bcd\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\u548c N \u4e2a\u524d\u540e\u53e5\u5b50. \u53e5\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u70b9\u5b66\u4e60\u53e5\u5b50\u5185\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u5355\u8bcd\u542b\u4e49, \u800c\u878d\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u83b7\u53e5\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49. \u6b64\u5916\u524d\u9762\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u6574\u5408\u5230\u878d\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u8bed\u97f3\u4fa7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f.</p> <p>In [91] Speech emotion recognition model (SER) is employed as a style descriptor to learn the implicit connection between style features and input text.

Furthermore, studies [20] [71] propose predicting the three prosody-related features, i.e., F0, energy, and duration, either by a single acoustic features predictor (AFP)[71] or via three separated predictors [20]. </p> <p>\u9664\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81, \u5176\u4ed6\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u97f5\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u97f5\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8f93\u51fa.  - \u6587\u732e [103] \u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u7ec4\u8bed\u8c03\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81, \u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u6570\u97f3\u9ad8, \u5bf9\u6570\u97f3\u9ad8\u8303\u56f4, \u5bf9\u6570\u97f3\u7d20\u65f6\u957f, \u5bf9\u6570\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u503e\u659c. - \u6587\u732e [048] \u7684\u97f3\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u97f3\u9ad8\u8868\u793a, \u4f7f\u7528\u77e2\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u503c. - \u6587\u732e [020] [071] \u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u5668 (AFP) \u6216\u4e09\u4e2a\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u4e09\u4e2a\u97f5\u5f8b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5f81, \u5373 F0, \u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u957f.</p> <p>Another type of emotion embedding is sentiment feature embedding, which is utilized to produce expressive speech by extracting sentiment information from the input text.

In some studies [55] [70] [116], style is modeled at a single speech/text level, while in other studies [68] [79] [133] a multi-level or hierarchical model of expressive styles is used to allow for a better capture of prosody var-iation in expressive speech. In single-level prosody modeling approaches, [55] is one of the early studies that extends a baseline with fine-grained control over the speaking style/prosody of syn-thesized speech. The proposed modification involves adding an embedding network with temporal structure to either the speech-side or text-side of the TTS model. Accordingly, the resulting prosody embedding is of vari-able length, and it is used to condition input to either encoder or decoder based on the position of the embed-ding network. Speech-side prosody embedding provides adjustment of prosody at frame-level, while text-side prosody embedding enables phoneme-level prosody control. Single-level prosody embeddings can be converted into discrete embeddings as in [70] [116].

A word-level refer-ence encoder is first used to obtain word-level prosody embedding from reference audio. A binary decision tree is employed to cluster embeddings with their identities based on their phonetic information. Prosody embed-dings of words in each leaf node will differ only in their prosodies. Then prosody embeddings of each leaf can be clustered via a GMM model where clusters represent prosody tags. If the applied GMM consists of five com-ponents and a tree of ten leaf nodes, a set of 50 prosody tags is produced. At inference time, prosody tags can be selected manually or via a prosody predictor that is trained to select appropriate prosody tags based on input text. In [70], an audiobook speech synthesis model is pro-posed. The model uses a character-acting-style extrac-tion module based on ResCNN [165] to extract different character acting styles from the input speech. Discrete character-level styles are obtained via vector quantization(VQ) [149], which maps them to a codebook, limiting the number of styles. At inference, the discrete character-act-ing-styles are predicted via a style predictor. The charac-ter-level style predictor uses both character embeddings from Skip-Gram [166] and text-based features from RoB-ERTa [167] as input. \u5728[116]\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u548cGMM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8bed\u8c03\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u8bcd\u7ea7\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u97f3\u9891\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8bed\u8c03\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u53c9\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u6839\u636e\u5176\u97f3\u7d20\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u4e2d\u5355\u8bcd\u7684\u8bed\u8c03\u5d4c\u5165\u4ec5\u5728\u8bed\u8c03\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7GMM\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53f6\u7684\u8bed\u8c03\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u805a\u7c7b\u8868\u793a\u8bed\u8c03\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5e94\u7528\u7684GMM\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5341\u4e2a\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6811\uff0c\u5219\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f50\u4e2a\u8bed\u8c03\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u8bed\u8c03\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u4ee5\u624b\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u8bed\u8c03\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8bed\u8c03\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u3002</p> <p>\u5728[70]\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u58f0\u8bfb\u7269\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eResCNN [165]\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u98ce\u683c\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u8bed\u97f3\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u77e2\u91cf\u91cf\u5316(VQ) [149]\u83b7\u5f97\u79bb\u6563\u89d2\u8272\u7ea7\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u98ce\u683c\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u79bb\u6563\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u89d2\u8272\u7ea7\u98ce\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81eaSkip-Gram [166]\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6765\u81eaRoBERTa [167]\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u3002</p> <p>Regarding multi-level prosody modeling, some stud-ies propose enhancing prosody control in the baseline models [74] [75] [77] by modifying their single-level pros-ody modeling to multiple levels. For instance, [133] pro-poses a hierarchical structure of [75] with multiple GST layers. Three GST layers are employed in the proposed model, each consisting of 10 tokens, which were found to yield better token interpretation. Tokens of the first and second layers were found to learn different speak-ers and styles, but these representations were not easily interpreted. Interestingly, the tokens in the third layer were able to generate higher quality samples with more distinct and interpretable styles. Specifically, third-layer styles exhibit clear differences in their features, includ-ing pitch, stress, speaking rate, start offset, rhythm, pause position, and duration. Model in [77] is further extended in [68] with three VAEs to generate three different levels (utterance, phrase,and word) of latent variables with varying time resolu-tions. Acoustic features and linguistic features are passed as input to the three VAEs. Initially, a conditional prior(CP) is applied to learn a distribution for sampling utter-ance-level latent variables based on linguistic features from the input text. The generated latent variables are passed to other levels via auto-regressive (AR) latent converters that convert latent variables from coarser-level to finer-level with input text condition. In fact, the utterance-level latent variables can be used to control the generated speech styles, regardless of latent variables of other levels, as they are predicted based on the utterance-level latent variables.</p> <p>The Controllable Expressive Speech Synthesis (ConEx)model in [79] proposes modeling prosody at two levels,utterance-level (global) and phone-level (local), using reference encoders [74]. However, the global prosody embedding is used to condition the local prosody embed-ding, resulting in an integrated prosody embedding. The local embeddings are 3D vectors that are converted into discrete local prosody embeddings (codes) via vec-tor quantization (VQ) [149]. At inference time, the integrated prosody embedding is predicted by an auto-regressive (AR) prior model trained to predict categori-cal distributions for each of the discrete codes utilizing global prosody embedding and the phoneme embed-ding as inputs. While global prosody embedding can be obtained from training samples or from an audio refer-ence, local prosody embeddings for a given global pros-ody embedding are achieved via the AR prior model. Fine-grained prosody control can be achieved by select-ing a specific phoneme to start adjusting prosody from. The AR prior model will first generate the top k pros-ody options for this phoneme. Then, the local prosody sequence will be generated autoregressively for each of the first top k options by the AR prior model.</p>","tags":["\u7efc\u8ff0","\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210","\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u97f3"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/Survey/DL-Based_Expressive_Speech_Synthesis/#532-modelingspecific-prosody-features","title":"5.3.2 Modeling\u2011specific prosody features","text":"<p>This group of studies provides individual representations of prosody-related features. Control over prosody of the synthesized speech is provided via selecting or adjust-ing a specific representation of a specific prosody-related feature. Some studies in this direction model prosody features at the global or utterance-level [97] [128], while other studies propose modeling at fine-grained lev-els [48] [63] [71] [122] [138], such as phoneme, syllable, or word-level. The STYLER model [97], for example, employs multi-ple style encoders to factor speech style into several com-ponents, including duration, pitch, speaker, energy, and noise. This structure enables STYLER to generate con-trollable expressive speech by adjusting each of the indi-vidually modeled features. Furthermore, with the explicit noise encoding, other encoders can be constrained to exclude noise information as a style factor, and thus the model can generate clean speech even with noisy refer-ences. Adjusting the style factors, various styles of speech can be generated from STYLER.</p> <p>\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0e\u97f5\u5f8b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5b9a\u97f5\u5f8b\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u6216\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u97f5\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81[97] [128]\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7814\u7a76\u5219\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u5efa\u6a21[48] [63] [71] [122] [138]\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u97f3\u7d20\u3001\u97f3\u8282\u6216\u5355\u8bcd\u7ea7\u522b\u3002</p> <p>\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cSTYLER\u6a21\u578b[97]\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u98ce\u683c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u51e0\u4e2a\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u97f3\u9ad8\u3001\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u4f7fSTYLER\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u72ec\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u8bed\u97f3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u566a\u58f0\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u6392\u9664\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u5608\u6742\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u98ce\u683c\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4eceSTYLER\u751f\u6210\u5404\u79cd\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u3002</p> <p>Adjusting several features at fine-grained levels can be a difficult task.  For example, FastSpeech2 provides fine-grained control over pitch range, duration,energy, which are modeled at the phone-level (phone-wise), and it is not easy to adjust these features to achieve a specific prosodic output.  Raitio and Seshadri [128] improves FastSpeech2 with an utterance-wise (coarse-grained) prosody model using an additional variance adaptor. That second variance adaptor is the same as the original one, but it models five features at the utterance-level: pitch, pitch range, duration, energy,and spectral tilt. These features are then concatenated with the corresponding output of the first variance adaptor. Such utterance-wise prosody model enables easier control of prosody while still allowing modification at the phone-level. To control high-level prosody,a bias is added to the corresponding utterance-wise prosody predictions. A phone-level prosody control is achieved by directly modifying the phone-wise features. Fine-grained control over a specific prosody-feature can also be required specially for strong speaking styles. To that end, in [71], a predictor is proposed to predict F0, energy, and duration features at the phoneme-level. During inference, the predicted features are generated based on the input text alone; however, they can also be provided externally and modified as desired. Furthermore, two prosody modeling levels are pro-posed in [63]: the local level (word-level) and global level (utterance-wise). The global prosody embedding is the emotion embedding obtained by a reference-based encoder. The local prosody embedding is obtained from a predictor of the F0 features at the word-level with global prosody embedding and the phoneme embed-ding as inputs. Both embeddings are then passed to a multi-style encoder to form the final multi-style pros-ody embedding. Therefore, modifying the predicted F0values can provide control of prosody at the utterance,word, and phoneme levels.</p> <p>\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u8c03\u6574\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cFastSpeech2 \u5728\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u522b\uff08\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u97f3\u9ad8\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u8c03\u6574\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002Raitio\u548cSeshadri[128]\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u989d\u5916\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6539\u8fdbFastSpeech2\uff0c\u8be5\u53d8\u5f02\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5728\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\uff08\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u97f5\u5f8b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u53d8\u5f02\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u53d8\u5f02\u9002\u914d\u5668\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e94\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u97f3\u9ad8\u3001\u97f3\u9ad8\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u503e\u659c\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u5f02\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u8f93\u51fa\u8fde\u63a5\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u6a21\u578b\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u97f5\u5f8b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u9ad8\u7ea7\u522b\u97f5\u5f8b\uff0c\u5411\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u97f5\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u6dfb\u52a0\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4fee\u6539\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u97f5\u5f8b\u63a7\u5236\u3002</p> <p>\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u97f5\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c[71]\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u522b\u7684F0\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u5916\u90e8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c[63]\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u97f5\u5f8b\u5efa\u6a21\u7ea7\u522b\uff1a\u5c40\u90e8\u7ea7\u522b\uff08\u5355\u8bcd\u7ea7\u522b\uff09\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7ea7\u522b\uff08\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\uff09\u3002\u5168\u5c40\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u662f\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u5c40\u90e8\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u662f\u4ece\u5177\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u97f3\u7d20\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u522b\u7684F0\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5165\u4f20\u9012\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u591a\u98ce\u683c\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u9884\u6d4b\u7684F0\u503c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u53e5\u5b50\u3001\u5355\u8bcd\u548c\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002</p> <p>More flexibility in controlling the F0 feature is pro-vided in the controllable deep auto-regressive model(C-DAR) model [138] which allows for F0 contour adjustment by the user. To achieve this goal, three strat-egies are used: 1) context awareness by conditioning the model on the preceding and following speech dur-ing training, 2) conditioning the model on some ran-dom segments of ground truth F0, and 3) predicting F0 values in reverse order. Additionally, several text-based features are used as input to the model, includ-ing word embeddings derived from BERT, V/UV label,one-hot vector for the nearby punctuation, and pho-neme encodings. At inference, F0 values specified by the user are used as alternatives for the ground truth F0 segments, and the model predicts the rest of the utter-ance\u2019s F0 contour through context awareness. Discrete fine-grained representations for prosody features as in [48] [122] are also useful to limit the number of the obtained representations. Both studies [48] [122]utilize VQ [149] to map each prosody embedding to the closest discrete representation from a predefined code-book. In [48], a pitch predictor is used to predict charac-ter-level continuous pitch representation using character embeddings from the text encoder as input. Zhang et al.[122], however, produces syllable-level prosody embed-dings from a reference encoder that takes F0, intensity,and duration features from reference audio as input. The resulting prosody embeddings are then mapped to a pre-defined codebook to extractb discrete prosody codes.</p> <p>\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6df1\u5ea6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08C-DAR\uff09\u6a21\u578b[138]\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9F0\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u63a7\u5236\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u6574F0\u8f6e\u5ed3\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5728\u5148\u524d\u548c\u968f\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\uff0c2\uff09\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5728\u5730\u9762\u771fF0\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u968f\u673a\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca3\uff09\u4ee5\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4bF0\u503c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5c06\u51e0\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7528\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4eceBERT\u6d3e\u751f\u7684\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u3001V/UV\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u9644\u8fd1\u6807\u70b9\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u4e00\u70ed\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u97f3\u7d20\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684F0\u503c\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u5730\u9762\u771fF0\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u6574\u4e2a\u53e5\u5b50\u7684F0\u8f6e\u5ed3\u3002</p> <p>\u4e0e[48] [122]\u4e2d\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u97f5\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\u4e5f\u5f88\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9650\u5236\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u4e24\u9879\u7814\u7a76[48] [122]\u90fd\u4f7f\u7528VQ[149]\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7801\u672c\u4e2d\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5728[48]\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u97f3\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u8fde\u7eed\u97f3\u9ad8\u8868\u793a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f20\u7b49\u4eba[122]\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u97f3\u8282\u7ea7\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8be5\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u53c2\u8003\u97f3\u9891\u7684F0\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u4ee3\u7801\u3002</p> <p>Resulting prosody codes in [48] represent the pitch and other suprasegmental information that can be adjusted via a specific bias value to generate speech with differ-ent pitch accents. The codes in [122], can be interpreted as representing some prosody features such as pitch and duration. The prosody variation at the syllable-level can be manually controlled by assigning each syllable the desired prosody code from the codebook. In [125], ToBI features, which involve a set of con-ventions used for transcribing and annotating speech prosody, are used. The applied ToBI features are four word-level tags: pitch accents, boundary tones, phrase accents, and break indices. The extracted ToBI tags are used as input to TTS model. Simultaneously, a ToBI pre-dictor is trained to predict these prosody tags based on grammatical and semantic information extracted from the input text using a self-supervised language model.

It proposes a phoneme-level emotion embed-ding and a fine-grained emotion intensity. The emo-tion embedding is first obtained via a reference encoder. The emotion intensity is then generated by an intensity extractor that takes the emotion embedding as input. The intensity extractor produces intensity as a scalar value based on the distance between the emotion embedding and the centroid of a pre-defined cluster for neutral emo-tion embeddings. The resulting emotion intensity values are quantized into pseudo-labels that serve as the index for an intensity embedding table. Another method for learning emotion strength values in an unsupervised manner is by using ranking functions. Studies [27] [31] [33] [64] utilize a ranking function-based method named relative attributes [89] for this purpose. In[33], prosody is modeled at three levels: global-level rep-resentation by emotion embedding, utterance-level rep-resented by prosody embedding from a reference-based encoder, and the local-level represented by emotion strength. The study trains an emotion strength extractor at the syllable-level based on input speech utilizing the ranking function. Simultaneously, a predictor of emo-tion strength is trained based on features extracted from input text via BERT model. Besides changing emotion label and emotion reference audio, the model provides manual control of the emotion strength values in the syn-thesized speech. Alternatively, the reference encoder in [31] functions as a ranking function to learn a phoneme-level emotion strength (descriptor) sequence. The proposed ranking function [89] receives its input from fragments of target reference audio obtained via a forced alignment model to phoneme boundaries. The OpenSMILE [139] tool is then used to extract 384-dimensional emotion-related features from these reference speech fragments as input to the ranking function. Similarly, the proposed ranking function in [27] takes a set of acoustic features extracted from the input speech via OpenSMILE tool but at the utter-ance-level as input. The ranking function leverages the difference between neutral samples and samples associ-ated with each emotion class in the dataset. The training process is formulated as solving a max-margin optimiza-tion problem. The resulting emotion strength scalars can be manually adjusted or predicted based on text or refer-ence speech. In [64], both emotion class and emotion strength value are obtained via a joint emotion predictor based only on the input text. The input to the predictor is features extracted from input text via the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-3 [88]. Emotion class and emotion strength are the two outputs of the predictor where the former is represented as a one-hot encoded vector and the latter is presented as a scalar value. Emotion labels and emotion strength values which are also obtained via[89], are used as ground truth for predictor training. Another ranking method is proposed in \"Cross-Speaker Emotion Transfer by Manipulating Speech Style Latents\" using the ranking support vector machine. The model generates style embedding and speaker embedding via two separate encoders. Both style and speaker embeddings at infer-ence time are represented by centroids of each single speaker and style embeddings. However, a linear SVM is trained with the model to provide the ability for style embedding adjustment. The proposed SVM model is trained to classify between neutral emotion and a specific emotion embedding, where the learned hyperplane is utilized to move(scale) the style vectors in a direction towards/opposite to the hyperplane. Another type of control that contributes to generat-ing speech with a better representation of local prosodic variation is introduced in [124]. The proposed model suggests an unsupervised approach to obtain word-level prominence and phrasal boundary strength features. For this purpose, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [168]is utilized to extract continuous estimates of word promi-nence and boundary information from the audio signal. First, the three prosodic signals f0, energy, and duration are extracted and combined as input to the CWT. Then,the combined signal is decomposed via CWT into scales that represent prosodic hierarchy. Word and phrase-level prosody are then obtained by following ridges or valleys across certain scales. The continuous word prominence and boundary estimates are achieved via the integration of the resulting lines aligned with the textual informa-tion. With manually identified intervals, the continuous values of prominence and boundary strength are then discretized.</p>","tags":["\u7efc\u8ff0","\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210","\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u97f3"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/Survey/DL-Based_Expressive_Speech_Synthesis/#534-prosody-clustering","title":"5.3.4 Prosody clustering","text":"<p>In this section, methods for selecting the appropri-ate prosody embedding for the referenced-based ETTS models are described. To begin with, clustering methods are utilized in [57] [58] to generate representative pros-ody embeddings for each emotion class when the GST-TTS model is trained with a labeled dataset. Initially,the resulting emotion embeddings are clustered in a 2d space. In [57], the centroid of each cluster is used as the weights of the GSTs to generate emotion embedding for each emotion class. In [58], the weight vector that repre-sents each emotion cluster is obtained by considering the inter and intra distances between emotion embedding clusters. Specifically, an algorithm is used for minimizing each embedding distance to the target emotion cluster and maximizing its distance to other emotion clusters. Similarly, clustering algorithms are applied in [112] [113] to achieve discrete prosody embeddings but for two specific prosody-related features. The two studies employ K-means algorithm to cluster F0 and duration features extracted for each phoneme. The centroids of the clus-ters are then used as discrete F0 and duration values/tokens for each phoneme. work [112] applies a balanced clustering method with duration features to overcome degradation in voice quality that appeared in [113] dur-ing duration control. Moreover, to keep phonetic and prosodic information separate during training, an atten-tion unit is introduced to map prosody tokens to decoder hidden states and generate prosody context vectors. The resulting discrete tokens for F0 and duration features provide a fine-grained level of control over prosody by changing the corresponding prosodic tokens for each phoneme. In [105], a cross-domain SER model with the GST-TTS model is proposed to obtain emotion embeddings for an unlabeled dataset. The cross-domain SER model is trained using two datasets including: 1) an SER data-set (source) labeled with emotions, and 2) a TTS data-set (target) that is not labeled. Simultaneously, the SER model trains an emotion classifier that generates soft labels for the unlabeled TTS dataset. These soft labels are then used to train an extended version of the baseline in[74] with an emotion predictor. In the training process,the weights of the style tokens layer are passed as input to the predictor, which employs the learned soft labels as ground truth values. At inference time, weights vectors for each emotion class are averaged to obtain the emo-tion class embedding. However, since the predicted labels for the TTS dataset are soft labels, and thus not entirely reliable, only the top K samples with the highest posterior probabilities are selected.</p>","tags":["\u7efc\u8ff0","\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210","\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u97f3"]},{"location":"TTS/Papers/Survey/DL-Based_Expressive_Speech_Synthesis/#54-speech-synthesis-for-unseen-speakers-and-unseen-styles","title":"5.4 Speech synthesis for unseen speakers and unseen styles","text":"<p>Building a speech synthesis model that supports mul-tiple speakers or styles can be achieved by training TTS model with a multi-speaker multi-style dataset. How-ever, generating speech for an unseen speaker or style is a challenging task for which several solutions have been proposed in the literature. A popular approach is to fine-tune the averaged TTS model with some samples from the unseen target speaker or style. The fine-tuning pro-cess may require a single sample from the unseen speaker or style (referred to as one-shot models) or a few samples(referred to as few-shot models). There are also models that do not require any fine-tuning steps, and these are known as zero-shot TTS models. For instance, the fine-tuning process proposed in [112]focused on sentences used in the process to ensure pho-netic coverage, meaning that each phoneme should appear at least once in these sentences. The proposed model requires about 5 minutes of recordings from the unseen target speaker to clone the voice and allow for manipulation of some voice features (such as F0 and duration) by the model at the phoneme-level. Another approach to address the problem of unseen data is to employ specific structures in the TTS model,as proposed in [52] [96] [97] [107]. As an example, in [107],a cycle consistency network is proposed with two Vari-ational Autoencoders (VAEs). The model incorporates two training paths: a paired path and an unpaired path. The unpaired path refers to training scenarios where the reference audio differs from the output (target) speech in terms of text, style, or speaker. Two separate style encod-ers are utilized in the model, with one dedicated to each path. This structure facilitates style transfer among intra-speaker, inter-speaker, and unseen speaker scenarios. In [52], the U-net structure proposed for the TTS model supports one-shot speech synthesis for unseen styles and speakers. The U-net structure is used between the style encoder and the mel decoder of the TTS model,with an opposite flow between them. Both the style encoder and decoder consist of multiple modules with the main building unit as ResCnn1D and instance nor-malization (IN) layers. The decoder receives phoneme embedding and produces the Mel-spectrogram as out-put. In parallel, the style encoder receives the reference audio and produces its linguistic content with guidance from the content (text) encoder. The style encoder mod-ules produce latent variables, i.e., mean, and standard deviation, for the hidden inputs in the IN layers. These latent variables are used to bias and scale the normal-ized hiddens of the corresponding module layers in the decoder. A separate encoder (reference encoder) has been used in [96] to extract speaker-related information besides the prosody encoder (extractor) that encodes prosody fea-tures into the prosody embedding. A prosody predictor is also trained to predict the prosody embedding based on the phoneme-embedding. While the instance nor-malization (IN) layer is utilized by the prosody extractor to remove global (speaker) information and to keep pros-ody-related information, the speaker encoder is designed with a special structure (Conv2D layers, residual blocks(GLU with fully connected layers), and a multi-head self-attention unit) for better extraction of speaker informa-tion. Moreover, instead of concatenation or summation with the decoder input, the speaker embedding is adap-tively affine transformed to the different FFT blocks of the decoder through a Speaker-Adaptive Linear Modu-lation (SALM) network that is inspired by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) [141]. The speaker encoder and conditioning of decoder blocks with speaker embed-ding allow the model to generate natural speech for unseen speakers with only a single reference sample(zero-shot).The attention unit used in seq2seq TTS models aims at mapping the different length between text and audio pairs. However, it can get unstable when the input is not seen during training [97]. The STYLER model has addressed this issue by using a linear compression or expansion of the audio to match the text\u2019s length via a method named Mel Calibrator. With this simplification of the alignment process as a scaling method, the unseen data robustness issue is alleviated and all audio-related style factors become dependent only on the audio. Similarly, in [119], the Householder Normalizing Flow[169] is incorporated into the VAE-based baseline model[77]. The Householder normalizing flow applies a series of easily invertible affine transformations to align the VAE\u2019s latent vectors (style embeddings) with a full covari-ance Gaussian distribution. As a result, the correlation among the latent vectors is improved. Generally, this architecture enhances the disentanglement capability of the baseline model and enables it to generate embedding for unseen style with just a single (one-shot) utterance of around one second length. The Multi-SpectroGAN TTS model proposed in [98]is a multi-speaker model trained based on adversarial feedback. The model supports the generation of speech for unseen styles/speakers by introducing adversarial style combination (ASC) during the training process. Style combinations result from mixing/interpolating style embeddings from different source speakers. The model is then trained with adversarial feedback using mixed-style mel-spectrograms. Two mixing methods are employed:binary selection or manifold mix-up via linear combina-tion. This training strategy enables the model to generate more natural speech for unseen speakers.</p> <p>Lastly, recent TTS models based on in-context learning (NaturalSpeech2, VALL-E, Voicebox) all share the capability to perform zero-shot speech synthesis, as explained in Section 4.4. In fact, the in-context training strategy underlies the ability of these models to synthesize speech given only a style prompt with the input text. Specifically, the synthesis process treats the provided prompt/reference as part of the desired output speech. Therefore, the model\u2019s goal is to predict the rest of this speech in the same style as the given part (prompt) and with the input text.
